# EMResource Integration Knowledge Base

This repository is the central resource for anyone who has built or is currently building an integration with EMResource.

Since every organization's environment is unique (due to varying EMR/EHR systems, team skillsets, and software), you likely won't find a single guide that perfectly matches your environment. Instead, our goal is to collect diverse real-world experiences that provide the crucial pieces you need to successfully build your own integration.

### Have you successfully integrated with EMResource? 
We strongly encourage you to share your project's details, including your implementation approach, technical hurdles, and any useful tips and tricks. 

### Why share? 
By sharing your experience, you help build a diverse collection of knowledge. It provides essential insights that others can use to build their own integration.
